The ampersand symbol before a variable changes the return type of the expression
to the direct memory address of the variable.

It is used to directly access a variable's value through its memory location.
This allows variables outside the function's scope to be modified by a function.

The code fragment would try to assign the input to memory location 123456 rather
than the variable 'n'. The program most likely does not have access to this location
and will crash.
