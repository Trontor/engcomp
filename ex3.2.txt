Exercise 3.2 (these should be done in tutorial 2):
    a) i=4, j=4
    b) i=3, j=5, k=9
    c) The second if statement evaluates always to TRUE because
        an positive integer always returns true.
        The correct if statement should be
            if (month == 4 || month == 6 || month == e.t.c.
        result is
        days=30
    d) The if statements aren't enclosed by curly braces, so even though
        the statements x = x + 1 and y = y + 2 are indented, they are
        not considered part of the if statement and thus run regardless
        of the comparison in the if statement.
        x=2, y=4
    e) The second if statement uses =, which is the ASSIGNMENT operator
        not ==, which is the EQUALITY operator
        Thus, the return will be the value of the left operand of the
        assignment (in this case, y).
        Something to note is that this expression reduces to
            else if (0)
        which doesn't execute.
        However, if x was > 0 then it would reduce to
            else if (1)
        which would execute the correct branch.
        The result for the given code is:
        y is greater
